I'm an experienced software developer with a passion for building impactful applications and solutions. With several years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in creating robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My toolkit includes a diverse range of programming languages and frameworks, making me proficient in both frontend and backend development.

I enjoy working with the following technologies:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, Ruby
- **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Angular, Vue.js
- **Backend Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, Django, Spring Boot
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines

I follow best practices in software development, like agile methodologies, code reviews, and automated testing. I'm particularly interested in building seamless user experiences and optimizing code for performance and maintainability.

Some of my recent projects include a real-time chat application using React and Node.js, an e-commerce platform leveraging Django and React, and a data visualization dashboard that integrates with multiple APIs.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects. Open source contributions are a significant part of my experience, and I actively seek opportunities to collaborate with other developers.

My GitHub repositories showcase a variety of projects:
- [Real-Time Chat App](https://github.com/lchristiansen1998896/chat-app)
- [E-Commerce Platform](https://github.com/lchristiansen1998896/e-commerce)
- [Data Visualization Dashboard](https://github.com/lchristiansen1998896/data-visualization)

I believe in continuous learning and regularly participate in coding challenges and online courses to enhance my skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, reading books, or hiking.
